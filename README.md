# Ramp

This repo contains helpers for provisioning infrastructure using
Terraform and Nix. Currently, this is split between Terraform modules
and NixOS modules, each of which need to be included independently in a
project. Ramp is intended to prioritize convention over configuration,
so that it can be quickly used to "ramp up" a project, without
significant overhead.

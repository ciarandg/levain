# Levain

This repo contains helpers for provisioning infrastructure using
Terraform and Nix. Currently, this is split between Terraform modules
and NixOS modules, each of which need to be included independently in a
project. Levain is intended to prioritize convention over configuration,
so that it can be quickly used to bootstrap a project, without
significant overhead.
